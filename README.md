# Project information

This is my submission for a project of "Google Front End Nanodegree Program" at Udacity and it is called "Feed Reader Testing".

In this project a web-based application that reads RSS feeds is given. Also, it includes [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and the first test suite.

I complete the project with adding additional test suites which are given as a list by the instructor.


# To open the project

You can clone this repository or download the .zip file to your computer. Then, click on the index.html file to see the RSS feeds and also [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) results which are at the bottom of the page.

The specs on this list are written at the feedreader.js file as test suites.

There are 4 test suites with some specs:
1) RSS Feeds
2) The Menu
3) Initial entries
4) New Feed Selection
